# Telecommunication-project
The success of the Data Science project will notably be based on a clearly defined corporate strategy.
This implies having a clear vision of the future and being able to work on the basis 
of realistic, clear short, medium and long term objectives.
For our project, we will:
 Study customer satisfaction for the different services for each operator.
 Find out a segmentation that will help us to classify our customers (gender, 
region, number of employees…) and therefore target a group of people 
during our future actions.
 Predict from customer emotions whether some customers will churn and 
based on this prediction we can take our actions to avoid customer 
dissatisfaction.


As for our data science objectives,
- we are going to use a business intelligence model where we will extract data 
from different sources and stock it in the staging area then we will use the 
staging area to load the data marts in our data warehouse while doing the 
necessary transformations, and with this we can do our reports.
- We are going to use internal and external data for the internal data We will 
use a data that we got from Tunisian telecommunication companies (Orange, 
Ooredoo, Tunisie Telecom) which is a survey that was collected from 
several companies. 
and for the external data We are going to collect data from Facebook which 
is the feedback of customers written in comments by using the web scraping.
- Then we will Transform the data structure into a useful information for 
business analysis.
This will help us put a business intelligence solution to visualize customer 
satisfaction according to different dimensions.
- We are going to train a model to predict the customer satisfaction by 
viewing their feedback and identifying dissatisfied customer groups to 
personalize campaigns toward different segments.
- we will deploy our website using Django.
